# Data Modeling Decisions

## Context

The project currently targets a local-first lakehouse for Yellow Taxi and Green
Taxi data. Taxi Zone Lookup is reference data for location enrichment.

Current flow:

1. `Bronze` keeps source data as raw as practical.
2. `Silver` normalizes Yellow and Green into one trip-level schema.
3. `Gold` serves BI, dashboards, and the read-only AI query API.

## Current Decision

The MVP now has two Gold serving layers:

- dimensional models: `dim_date`, `dim_zone`, `dim_service_type`,
  `dim_vendor`, `dim_payment_type`, `fact_trips`
- curated aggregate marts: `gold_daily_kpis`, `gold_zone_demand`

The aggregate marts remain the AI-preferred serving surface:

- `gold_daily_kpis`
- `gold_zone_demand`

This matches the current question patterns: daily KPIs, service type splits, and
zone-level demand. Aggregate marts keep the AI query surface small, reduce joins,
and make guardrails easier to reason about.

## Why Dim/Fact Was Added After MVP Verification

Dim/fact modeling was deferred until the basic MVP flow was verified because it
adds early complexity:

- More grain, key, and join-policy decisions.
- Higher risk of Text-to-SQL generating invalid or overly detailed joins.
- More guardrail complexity than a small set of curated Gold marts.

After ingestion, transforms, data quality checks, and safe AI querying were
verified, the Gold dimensional layer was added. The marts still exist so common
queries do not need to touch fact-level data directly.

## Implemented Dimensional Layer

Implemented Gold dimensional models:

- `dim_date`
- `dim_zone`
- `dim_service_type`
- `dim_vendor`
- `dim_payment_type`
- `fact_trips`

`fact_trips` has one row per valid Silver trip. It is the base for better marts
and drill-down analysis, with join keys for date, service type, vendor, payment
type, pickup zone, and dropoff zone. It does not replace aggregate marts.

`gold_daily_kpis` and `gold_zone_demand` are serving marts built from
`fact_trips` and related dimensions.

## AI Query Rules

- AI may query only Gold objects listed in the semantic catalog.
- Prefer aggregate marts for common questions.
- Keep `fact_trips` out of the AI catalog until its grain, metrics, and safe join
  paths are cataloged.
- Never expose Bronze or Silver to AI.
- Never allow DML, DDL, or external file access.
