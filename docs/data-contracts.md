# Data Contracts

## Sources In Scope

- `yellow_tripdata_YYYY-MM.parquet`
- `green_tripdata_YYYY-MM.parquet`
- `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` as a reference dataset

## Bronze Contract

- Preserve source files with minimal mutation.
- Store files in partitioned paths by service type, year, and month.
- Keep naming close to the original TLC source names.

Expected local paths:

- `data/bronze/yellow_taxi/year=YYYY/month=MM/...`
- `data/bronze/green_taxi/year=YYYY/month=MM/...`
- `data/reference/taxi_zone_lookup/taxi_zone_lookup.csv`

## Silver Contract

Unified trip rows should include at least:

- `service_type`
- `pickup_date`
- `pickup_at`
- `dropoff_at`
- `pickup_zone_id`
- `dropoff_zone_id`
- `trip_distance`
- `fare_amount`
- `total_amount`

Silver should normalize Yellow and Green into the same semantic shape.
Taxi Zone Lookup may be joined as reference data, but it does not change the
fact-source scope of the project.

## Gold Contract

Gold is the serving layer for analytics and AI.

Current marts:

- `gold_daily_kpis`
- `gold_zone_demand`

Rules:

- prefer explicit metrics and dimensions
- keep `service_type` when combining Yellow and Green
- use only business-safe, curated columns for AI access
